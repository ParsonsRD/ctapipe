Fix units (absence of) for skewness and excess kurtosis in muon analysis
The muon ring fitter needs to be improved.
The existing toy tests for muons are overly simplified.
Upgrade the taubin_circle_fit with weights to avoid bias toward rings with larger radii.
Additionally, the function may use the defined initial parameters (xc, yc, R): center (xc, yc) and radius R of the fitted circle). The function is backward compatible.
Add a combined ring fitting method (kundu_chaudhuri_taubin) We use the Chaudhuri-Kundu formula to calculate the initial muon ring parameters and feed them into the modified Taubin fit with weights.
Updated the test with an additional fitting method, each method is tested separately. Enhance the toy model for muon ring simulation by incorporating user-defined asymmetry in both the x and y directions. Updating the muon ring fitter test to include ring asymmetry. It is noticeable that a ring with less asymmetry can still be fitted using the Chaudhuri-Kundu method (not a true fit), while a ring with larger asymmetry can only be accurately fitted using the updated Taubin circle fit and the newly introduced method.
A ring fitter testfunction is backward compatible.
Removing the support functions. Please ignore them while reviewing the code.
