The muon ring fitter needs to be improved.

- Upgrade the taubin_circle_fit with weights to avoid bias toward rings with larger radii.
- the function may use the defined initial parameters : ring center and radius
- Add a combined ring fitting method (kundu_chaudhuri_taubin).
- Updated the test with an additional fitting method, each method is tested separately.
- The modified functions are backward compatible.
