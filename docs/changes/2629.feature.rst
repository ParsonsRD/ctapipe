This commit adds two new hillas-parameter variables:
1. psi_uncertainty (uncertainty on the psi angle of the image)
2. transverse_cog_uncertainty (uncertainty on the center of gravity along the transverse axis of the image)

The method that estimates these uncertainties has been presented at these ASWG calls:

https://indico.cta-observatory.org/event/5900/contributions/47899/attachments/26789/39379/Psi_uncertainty_short_summary_20241022.pdf

The affected files are:
image/hillas.py
containers.py

Caution:
These uncertainties are calculated using the the information of pixel area and the charges in the pixels.
In order to obtain the accurate uncertainties, the charges in the image should be counted above the NSB noise fluctuation or the boundary threshold for the image cleaning.
